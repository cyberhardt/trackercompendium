Description: This is a list of active, responsible, user- and privacy-respecting trackers that follow certain criteria I have stabilished.

-

Trackers on this list follow the certain criteria:

1 - Their website exists and is accessible by normal means

2 - Their website has updated information (not dead or abandoned)

3 - Their website has information related to the tracker, preferably on the front page (musn't be unrelated to torrenting, either)

4 - Their creator/maintainer has explicitly stated that the tracker does not store any personal information besides what is necessary to run the tracker

5 - Their creator/maintainer has explicitly stated that the tracker is privacy-respecting

6 - Their website is in english or has an english section

7 - The tracker is public and free to use

8 - Their site isn't sketchy

-

My personal favourite sites when it comes to torrenting are DHT crawlers. I recommend bitsearch.to and bt4g.com
