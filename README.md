Description: This is a curated list of active, responsible, user- and privacy-respecting trackers that follow certain criteria I have stabilished.

Regarding the Scripts folder: You can use the .bat files to quickly add trackers to your torrents. There are 2 .bats: one with the compliant trackers, and another with all of them. In order to use it, you'll need Transmission CLI installed (https://github.com/transmission/transmission) - you **don't** need to install the GUI. You'll need to edit the path to include your user (either that, or use some other path of your choice). You can, of course, add or remove trackers from the bat, just make sure to add -a before each tracker you want to add, and -d before those you want to remove. The script works like that: it will add the specified trackers to all .torrent files inside the specified folder. I've also included 2 additional scripts, identifiable by the -remove in their filenames, which will remove **all** trackers before adding the new ones.

Trackers on this list follow the certain criteria:

1 - Their website exists and is accessible by normal means

2 - Their website has updated information (not dead or abandoned)

3 - Their website has information related to the tracker, preferably on the front page (musn't be unrelated to torrenting, either)

4 - Their creator/maintainer has explicitly stated that the tracker does not store any personal information besides what is necessary to run the tracker

5 - Their creator/maintainer has explicitly stated that the tracker is privacy-respecting

6 - Their website is in english or has an english section

7 - The tracker is public and free to use

8 - Their site isn't sketchy

My personal favourite sites when it comes to torrenting are DHT crawlers. I recommend bitsearch.to and bt4g.com

My personal favourite client is PicoTorrent, second place would go to utorrent 2.2.1 (on Windows). I recommend them both, but I strongly suggest against using newer versions of utorrent.
