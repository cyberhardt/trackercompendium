Description: This is a curated list of active, responsible, user- and privacy-respecting trackers that follow certain criteria I have stabilished.

The torrent-blacklist is basically a list of all trackers except those in the compendium. It will be used for the scripts.

Regarding the Scripts folder: You can use the .bat files to quickly add trackers to your torrents. There are 2 .bats: one with the compliant trackers, and another with all of them. In order to use it, you'll need Transmission CLI installed (https://github.com/transmission/transmission) - you **don't** need to install the GUI. By default, the path is C:\torrents, but you can change it to whatever you want. The script works like that: it will add the specified trackers to all .torrent files inside the specified folder. I've also included 2 additional scripts, identifiable by the -remove in their filenames, which will remove all trackers present in the tracker-blacklist before adding the new ones. Needles to mention, the scripts were made for Windows.

Trackers on this list follow the certain criteria:

1 - Their website exists and is accessible by normal means

2 - Their website has updated information (not dead or abandoned)

3 - Their website has information related to the tracker, preferably on the front page (musn't be unrelated to torrenting, either)

4 - Their creator/maintainer has explicitly stated that the tracker does not store any personal information besides what is necessary to run the tracker

5 - Their creator/maintainer has explicitly stated that the tracker is privacy-respecting

6 - Their website is in english or has an english section

7 - The tracker is public and free to use

8 - Their site isn't sketchy

My favourite sites when it comes to torrenting are DHT crawlers. I recommend bitsearch.to and bt4g.com.

My favourite client is PicoTorrent, second place would go to utorrent 2.2.1 (on Windows). I recommend them both, but I strongly suggest against using newer versions of utorrent. Qbittorrent, while being a great client visual- and function-wise, is way too buggy for my taste. Others like Transmission and Deluge lack essential functions.
